## AI-Based Satellite Signal Performance and Failure Prediction System Using Weather and Historical Data

SATELLITO is a machine learning-powered web application developed to predict satellite signal performance and communication failure risk based on environmental conditions. The system utilizes weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed to estimate signal strength and classify operational risk levels.

The project combines Machine Learning, Flask, React.js, and Data Visualization techniques to provide an interactive dashboard for predictive satellite communication monitoring.

SATELLITO addresses this challenge by providing:

* Real-time signal strength prediction
* Failure risk estimation
* Interactive web dashboard
* Historical prediction tracking
* Visual analytics and trend monitoring

The system enables users to proactively assess communication reliability under varying environmental conditions.
